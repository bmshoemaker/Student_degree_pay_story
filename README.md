# Student_degree_pay_story

Using 3 data resources, I will try to prove or disprove the following hypothesis:

- Engineering has the highest starting salary.
- Graduates of Ivy League schools earn the most. 
- The region of the school has no effect on earnings. 
- A strong relationship does exist between starting salary and mid-career salaries.
